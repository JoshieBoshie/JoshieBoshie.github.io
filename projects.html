			<p id = "des"> At UC Berkeley, getting specialized help with computer science courses,

				 or Piazza for help for private tutors and vice versa. However, it was very difficult for students and tutors
				 to actually contact with one another and discuss what the student needed help with due to the nature of the
				 apps. Our objective of the application is to give students and tutors to interact with each other
				 and give a better interactive interface to manage and discuss what the student needs help with and
				 communicate.
